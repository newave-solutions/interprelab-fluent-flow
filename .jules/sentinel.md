## 2024-05-24 - Hardcoded Secrets in Client and XSS Potential

**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded fallback values for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`. Also identified XSS vulnerability in `src/pages/Article.tsx` using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization.
**Learning:** Providing hardcoded fallbacks for secrets (even if 'anon') encourages poor security hygiene and creates a risk if the repository is cloned or forked (pointing to the original backend). It also bypasses environment configuration validation.
**Prevention:** Always rely on environment variables for configuration. Throw explicit errors if required variables are missing to fail fast and securely. Use libraries like `dompurify` for any HTML injection.

## 2025-02-23 - Hardcoded Secrets in Setup Scripts

**Vulnerability:** Found hardcoded `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and project URL in `setup-github-actions.sh`.
**Learning:** Even in setup instructions, hardcoding secrets encourages bad practices and leaks project-specific configuration in the repository history. Users might blindly commit these or assume it's safe to hardcode them elsewhere.
**Prevention:** Use placeholders (e.g., `<YOUR_KEY>`) in scripts and documentation, and direct users to the source of truth (e.g., dashboard, environment variables).

## 2025-02-23 - Content Security Policy Mismatch

**Vulnerability:** `nginx.conf` contained a hardcoded Content Security Policy (CSP) referencing an outdated/unused Supabase Project ID (`iokgkrnbawhizmuejluz`), while the application code (`.env.production`, `config.toml`) utilized different project IDs (`opmafykbhjinqebgflnl`, `ggyzlvbtkibqnkfhgnbe`).
**Learning:** Hardcoding specific external domains in static configuration files (like nginx.conf) creates a high risk of service denial in production if the backend infrastructure changes, as the CSP will block legitimate traffic. This is a common "Configuration Drift" issue.
**Prevention:** Use environment variable substitution (e.g., `envsubst`) in container startup scripts to inject the correct allowed domains into the CSP at runtime, ensuring the security policy always matches the active environment configuration.

## 2025-02-23 - DOM-based XSS in Vanilla JS Chrome Extension

**Vulnerability:** Found multiple `innerHTML` assignments in `public/chrome-extension/content-script.js` directly injecting dynamically generated or matched text without prior sanitization. Specifically, medical terms and variables matched via Regex were wrapped in HTML strings and assigned to the DOM, exposing the extension to DOM-based XSS via malicious input data.
**Learning:** Chrome extensions running in vanilla JS are often overlooked when security libraries like `DOMPurify` are used elsewhere in a React application. Direct DOM manipulation with `.innerHTML` requires explicit sanitization or strict encoding of any variable content.
**Prevention:** Always create a lightweight `escapeHTML` helper function for vanilla JS content scripts and explicitly wrap all dynamic content before template literal injection when `textContent` or `innerText` cannot be used instead.
