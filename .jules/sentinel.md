## 2024-05-24 - Hardcoded Secrets in Client and XSS Potential
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded fallback values for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`. Also identified XSS vulnerability in `src/pages/Article.tsx` using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization.
**Learning:** Providing hardcoded fallbacks for secrets (even if 'anon') encourages poor security hygiene and creates a risk if the repository is cloned or forked (pointing to the original backend). It also bypasses environment configuration validation.
**Prevention:** Always rely on environment variables for configuration. Throw explicit errors if required variables are missing to fail fast and securely. Use libraries like `dompurify` for any HTML injection.
