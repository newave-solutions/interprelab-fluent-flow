## 2025-02-23 - Hardcoded Secrets in Setup Scripts
**Vulnerability:** Found hardcoded `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and project URL in `setup-github-actions.sh`.
**Learning:** Even in setup instructions, hardcoding secrets encourages bad practices and leaks project-specific configuration in the repository history. Users might blindly commit these or assume it's safe to hardcode them elsewhere.
**Prevention:** Use placeholders (e.g., `<YOUR_KEY>`) in scripts and documentation, and direct users to the source of truth (e.g., dashboard, environment variables).
