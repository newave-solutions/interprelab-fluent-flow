**Learning:** Users often click audio buttons repeatedly because they lack immediate visual feedback that the system is "working" or "playing", especially if the audio takes a split second to start or is quiet.
**Action:** When triggering `speechSynthesis`, always pair it with a visual state (like a pulsing icon) that persists until the `onend` event fires. This confirms the action and prevents rage-clicking.
