## A/B Testing Note

**InterpreCoach Implementation:**
This project implements two different versions of the InterpreCoach solution for A/B testing purposes:

1. **Current Version** (in `/interprecoach` route): Standard solution with AI coaching features
2. **Agentic Version** (removed from Extension UI): Multi-agent system implementation with distributed AI agents

The agentic version with multi-agent architecture has been removed to allow for performance comparison. Future A/B testing will help determine which approach users prefer and which performs better in real-world scenarios.

Key differences to test:
- Single AI model vs. multi-agent system
- User experience and response quality
- Performance and resource usage
- User preference and satisfaction
